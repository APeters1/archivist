    across the screen, the USB key has not been inserted properly. Please exit the
    assessment by pressing escape and select ‘NEED TO REDO ASSESSMENT(S) BECAUSE IN

    the software key and reinsert it. If you have more than one USB port, try inserting
    the software key in a different port. Once you have done that, continue with the
    assessment(s) again.

    personal interview (CAPI). The survey instrument was written as a computer program
    using BLAISE software. This is the documentation of the program. It shows the
    wording of questions, instructions to the nurse, routing (i.e. the rules which
    dictated the questions asked) and - at the end of the document - checks built
    into the program to ensure that data was entered correctly. The last include 'soft'
    checks, to remind nurses of procedures or signal improbable values, and 'hard'
    checks, which excluded values outside a pre-determined range or unacceptable combinations
    of response codes.

  literal: This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made
    by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of Medical
    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. The children in
    this survey are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in
    March 1946. They are drawn from all social classes and during the first fourteen
    years of their lives less than 10 per cent of the children in the original sample
    have been lost. The value of this inquiry depends on information being obtained
    for every possible survey child. The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious
    that this form should be completed.

  literal: There are some questions about each best friend that you nominate. You
    can nominate 5 friends, or less, if you want to. Don't include brothers and sisters
    in here, but you can include boyfriends or girlfriends. You don't need to worry
    about the order you write them down in. The researchers will take the people as
    just five best friends - they won't assume that the one you write down first is
    your best best friend.When you are finished filling in the details on your friends,
    please go to Page 24 for a few final questions.

    the teenager will not be living with his/her own (i.e. natural) mother. In this
    case the term mother throughout the form should be taken to imply present mother
    figure and similarly father should be taken to imply present father figure.

    account has been obtained of their health and development during the past 15 years.
    The children come from all types of home and are attending all types of school,
    both Independent and Local Authority. They are now reaching the age when many
    of them will be leaving school and the Joint Committee feels some uniform assessment
    of their progress together with background information about the secondary schools
    they have been attending is most desirable. During the past 15 years only 10 per
    cent of the children have been lost and the value of this inquiry depends on our
    continuing to obtain information for every possible survey child. '

    list you have answered. The list you should use to fill in the answers to question
    2.2 is shown in a box in the lower half of page 7 of this questionnaire. Turn
    to this and memorise whether you are to use list A or B. If necessary, write it
    down on a separate piece of paper which you can destroy later. Then erase the
    letter A or B in the box by writing over it in ink. Then answer question 2.2.
    Nobody but yourself and us will know which list you have used. Remember also that
    you are able to seal up the questionnaire in a special envelope, so that nobody
    will see your answers.

  literal: This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey of the health, growth
    and development of children. With the help of his parents and of health visitors,
    school nurses and teachers, a detailed account has been obtained of his health
    and development during the past 13 years. The survey children come from all types
    of home and are attending all types of school both independent and Local Authority.
    During the past 13 years only 6 per cent have been lost and the value of this
    inquiry depends on our continuing to obtain information for every possible survey
    child.

    a youngster a little further to enable you to classify his answer more easily.
    But do not read out the pre-coded answers as suggestions, except where the instruction
    "show" is given. This is most important, as otherwise uncontrollable bias may
    be introduced.

    confinement and the subsequent care of the baby. In order to make a satisfactory
    study of prematurity the Joint Committee are most anxious to obtain the supplementary
    information asked for in this questionnaire. Each premature baby has been matched
    with a mature one of the same sex, the same position in the family and of the
    same social and economic group. It is hoped that the information asked for below
    can be supplied for the mature "controls" as well as for the premature babies.

    feels that, before this change is made, some uniform assessment of their progress
    is desirable and for this reason the accompanying tests (Forms N.F.3) are being

    the tests by providing essential background information about the schools themselves.

    and disadvantaged children and the ways in which their lives, and the lives of
    their families, may differ compared with those of other children. Our interest
    continues to focus on the vital relationship between the home and school environments
    and how these affect the child's development and progress at the end of the primary
    stage of education. The questions are relevant to current issues concerning the
    health and welfare of all children and their families.

    the person who can best answer questions about the child's health and development.
    Sometimes the child will not be living with his/her own (i.e. natural) mother.
    In this case the term 'mother' throughout the form should be taken to imply 'present
    mother figure' and, similarly, 'father' should be taken to imply 'present father
    figure'.

    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. Details of health
    and development have been recorded at two yearly intervals during the pre-school
    years and it is hoped that, during the primary school period, a clinical examination
    will be made by the School Doctor each year and a record of illnesses made each
    term by the School Nurse. The aim of the present examination is to bring the medical
    and social history up to date, to check information previously noted, and to record
    the clinical state of the child. This will complete our information for the whole
    of the pre-school period.

    examination, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of doctors who
    are examining them should record their findings in a comparable way. For this
    reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this examination form
    has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one
    of several printed alternatives. All that is required is to put a circle round
    the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings.
    If no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the
    question. Similarly if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does
    not fully explain your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information
    you can give us. When a question does not apply it should be struck through. When
    either the Doctor or the Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact should
    be recorded in the space directly under the question.

    As parental recall of past events is often incomplete, reference to pre-school
    child health records is also essential as a means of confirming and supplementing
    information obtained by the Health Visitor in the home interview.

    Additional information about any developmental check-ups at G.P. practices or
    health centres would be valuable, and may be readily available to health visitors
    attached to G.P. practices. Developmental check-ups are sometimes carried out
    elsewhere, e.g. at hospital birth follow-up clinics, and vision and hearing are
    often screened during routine medical examination at day nursery, nursery and
    infant school. This information would be appreciated if it is readily available."

  literal: This term does not refer to an isolated single screening test, though specific
    screening tests may often be included in the general observations and examination
    made of the child's developmental achievements. General developmental examinations
    or check-ups of overall developmental progress are usually carried out at or near
    prescribed ages in C.H.C, home or G.P.'s practices by doctor or health visitor.
    The result is often entered on C.H.C. or H.V. records under several headings of
    'developmental' function e.g. hearing and language, posture and locomotion, vision,
    social behaviour, or may be entered in the form of observations of individual
    developmental achievements of the child, e.g. sitting, smiling, saying single
    words, etc. If neither of these forms of recording are present in the notes, but
    it is definitely indicated that a general developmental check-up was made, this
    should be included.  Please include also any record you may have of a general
    medical examination or check-up carried out by a doctor at nursery or infant school.

    test at age 3 years. If the details of the type of test used are not clear but
    the records indicate that vision, hearing or both have been checked, such entries
    should be included as vision or hearing tests.

    where records indicate a specific test was made, e.g. cover test or light reflection
    test, or where the records indicate only if a squint was, or was not, evident
    in the course of a general examination. Records of any such test(s) for vision,
    hearing or squint carried out at nursery or infant school should also be included.

    by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of Medical
    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. They are drawn
    from all social classes and during the first ten years of their lives only 8 per
    cent. of the children in the original sample have been lost. The value of this
    inquiry depends on information being obtained for every possible survey child.
    The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

  literal: Five thousand children scattered all over the country are being given this
    examination, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of doctors who
    are examining them should record their findings in a comparable way. For this
    reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this examination form
    has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one
    of several printed alternatives. All that is required is to put a circle round
    the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings.
    If no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the
    question. Similarly, if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does
    not fully explain your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information
    you can give us. When a question does not apply it should be struck through. When
    either the Doctor or the Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact should
    be recorded in the space directly under the question.

    very comprehensive information was obtained about each child and mother. The results
    of this study, the 1958 Perinatal Mortality Survey, have already had a considerable
    impact with a consequent improvement in maternity services and a saving of infant
    life.

  literal: With so much information already available about the children, a unique
    opportunity presents itself now for relating the ante-natal and birth history
    of the children to their present development. There is as yet much to learn about
    the influence of conditions before and at birth on normal educational, physical
    and emotional growth. There is, too, much to be discovered about the causes and
    effects of many handicaps and even about their incidence in the child population.
    Particularly is this the case for minor handicaps, which may nevertheless be educationally
    significant. A detailed study of a large and representative group affords the
    opportunity of answering some of these questions.

    the National Child Development Study (1958 Cohort) is being sponsored by the four
    organisations detailed on the front of this booklet. The present phase of this
    study, which will cover some 16,000 children, is being financed from Government
    funds. It is inevitable in an undertaking of this size that a good deal of the
    information to be obtained will be gathered by individual doctors, health visitors,
    head and class teachers. We are most grateful for the assurances which have already
    been received that maximum co-operation will be given to this study. We do not
    underestimate the amount of work involved but we hope that you will feel the project
    worthy of your professional skill and time.

    can be examined by a doctor, who will complete the Medical Questionnaire.

    child's mother. If for any reason the mother is unavailable, please interivew
    the person who can best answer questions about the child's health and development.
    Occasionally, a child will not now be living with his own (i.e. natural) mother.
    In this circumstance, please interview the person who has become for the child
    a, more or less, permanent mother substitute. Throughout the questionnaire the
    term "mother" should be taken to imply the child's mother or the permanent mother
    substitute, except on those few occasions where the term "own mother" is used.
    The word "father" refers to the child's father or, where appropriate, to the male
    head of the household.

    the 21st century by following around 19,000 children born in the UK in 2000/2001,
    and their families. Your 5-year old brother or sister is one of the children included
    in this study. He or she has been asked to do some measurements with the interviewer,
    who has also talked to your parents. We are also interested in you. We'd like
    to complete the picture of your family by asking you some questions of your own.These
    are designed for people aged 10-15 which  is why you have been asked to do this.
    If there are more than two 10-15 year olds in your family, you have been selected
    by chance by the computer.

    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. Details of health
    and development have been recorded at two yearly intervals during the pre-school
    years and it is hoped that, during the primary school period, a clinical examination
    will be made by the School Doctor each year and a record of illnesses made each
    term by the School Nurse. The aim of the present examination is to bring the medical
    and social history up to date, to check information previously noted, and to record
    the clinical state of the child. This will complete our information for the whole
    of the pre-school period.

    no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question.
    Similarly if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully

    by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of Medical
    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee. The purpose of
    the present examination is to bring the medical and social history up to date.
    The children in this sample are representative of all births in England, Wales
    and Scotland. They are drawn from all social classes and during the first ten
    year of their lives only 8% of the original sample have been lost. The value of
    this inquiry depends on information being obtained for every possible survey child.
    The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that this form should be completed.

  literal: Five thousand Mothers scattered all over the country are being interviewed,
    and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of Health Visitors and School
    Nurses who are seeing them should record their findings in a comparable way. For
    this reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this form has been
    framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several
    printed alternatives. All that is required is to put a circle round the number
    opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative
    fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly,
    if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain
    your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information you can
    give us. In order to ensure that this information is obtained in the same way
    by the many people taking part in the survey, it is important that the wording
    and order of this form should be adhered to.

    this reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this form has been
    framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one of several
    printed alternatives. All that is required is to put a circle round the number
    opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings. If no alternative
    fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question. Similarly,
    if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully explain
    your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information you can
    give us.

  literal: This child was enrolled at birth in a national survey which is being made
    by a Joint Committee of the Institute of Child Health, the Society of Medical
    Officers of Health and the Population Investigation Committee.  The children in
    this survey are representative of all births in England, Wales and Scotland in
    March 1946.  They are drawn from all social classes and during the first seven
    years of their lives only 8 per cent. of the children in the original sample have
    been lost.  The value of this inquiry depends on information being obtained for
    every possible survey child.  The Joint Committee are therefore most anxious that
    this form should be completed.

  literal: Six thousand children scattered all over the country are being given this
    examination, and it is therefore important that the many hundreds of doctors who
    are examining them should record their findings in a comparable way.  For this
    reason, and also to reduce the amount of clerical work, this examination form
    has been framed as a series of questions, many of which can be answered by one
    of several printed alternatives.  All that is required is to put a circle round
    the number opposite the printed answer that most nearly describes your findings.  If
    no alternative fits please write the answer in the space directly under the question.
    Similarly if you feel that any printed answer, though applicable, does not fully
    explain your findings, we should be most grateful for any further information
    you can give us.  When a question does not apply it should be struck through.
    When either the Doctor or the Mother is unable to answer a question, this fact
    should be recorded in the space directly under the question.

    can be so bad that people may feel suicidal or want to self-harm. The following
    questions ask you about your feelings and the feelings of people close to you.
    We know this is a sensitive subject, but it is important to ask about it now,
    as it is not uncommon. By finding out about self-harm we can find ways of helping
    people.
