    study child of child health clinics, health visiting facilities, developmental

    As parental recall of past events is often incomplete, reference to pre-school
    child health records is also essential as a means of confirming and supplementing
    information obtained by the Health Visitor in the home interview.

  literal: This term does not refer to an isolated single screening test, though specific
    screening tests may often be included in the general observations and examination
    made of the child's developmental achievements. General developmental examinations
    or check-ups of overall developmental progress are usually carried out at or near
    prescribed ages in C.H.C, home or G.P.'s practices by doctor or health visitor.
    The result is often entered on C.H.C. or H.V. records under several headings of
    'developmental' function e.g. hearing and language, posture and locomotion, vision,
    social behaviour, or may be entered in the form of observations of individual
    developmental achievements of the child, e.g. sitting, smiling, saying single
    words, etc. If neither of these forms of recording are present in the notes, but
    it is definitely indicated that a general developmental check-up was made, this
    should be included.  Please include also any record you may have of a general
    medical examination or check-up carried out by a doctor at nursery or infant school.

  literal: Vision and hearing may be tested on their own or as part of a general developmental
    examination or check-up of overall developmental progress. They are routine clinical
    procedures used for testing these special functions, e.g. routine testing of hearing
    by rattle, paper etc. by H.V. at 7-9 months, screening of vision by Stycar 5-letter
    test at age 3 years. If the details of the type of test used are not clear but
    the records indicate that vision, hearing or both have been checked, such entries
    should be included as vision or hearing tests.

    where records indicate a specific test was made, e.g. cover test or light reflection
    test, or where the records indicate only if a squint was, or was not, evident
    in the course of a general examination. Records of any such test(s) for vision,
    hearing or squint carried out at nursery or infant school should also be included.
